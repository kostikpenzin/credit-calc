$params = new CreditParams(new DateTime('2023-10-31 00:00:00'), 100000000, 990, 12, CreditParams::DURATION_MONTH);
$unexpectedPayments = [
    new UnexpectedPayment(10000000, new DateTime('2023-12-15 00:00:00'), UnexpectedPayment::LESS_PAYMENT),
    new UnexpectedPayment(3565411, new DateTime('2023-01-13 00:00:00'), UnexpectedPayment::LESS_LOAN_PERIOD),
    new UnexpectedPayment(15000000, new DateTime('2023-02-29 00:00:00'), UnexpectedPayment::LESS_LOAN_PERIOD),
];

$calculator = new Calculator;

// we consider the repayment schedule with annuity payments
// So that there are differentiated payments, we specify Calculator::TYPE_TYPE_DIFFERENT as the third parameter

/** @var RepaymentSchedule $schedule Payment schedule */
$schedule = $calculator->calculate($params, $unexpectedPayments, Calculator::TYPE_ANNUITY);
foreach ($schedule as $repayment) {
    /** @var DateTime $date Date of the next payment period */
    $date = $repayment->getDate()->format('d.m.Y');

    /** @var int $payment The amount of the next payment */
    $payment = $repayment->getPayment();

    /** @var int $percents Interest on the next payment */
    $percents = $repayment->getPercents();

    /** @var int $body The body of the loan for the next payment */
    $body = $repayment->getBody();

    /** @var int $body Loan balance after payment */
    $balance = $repayment->getBalance();
}

/** @var int $total Get the amount of all loan payments */
$total = $schedule->calculateTotalPayments();

/** @var int $overpayment Get the amount of overpayment on the loan */
$overpayment = $schedule->calculateOverpayment();

/** @var int $requestedSum Get the loan amount */
$requestedSum = $schedule->getCreditParams()->getRequestedSum();

/** @var string psk The full cost of the loan as a percentage per annum with rounding up to 3 digits */
$psk = $schedule->calculateTotalCost();
